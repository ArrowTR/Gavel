# Gavel
Hey, I am ArrowTR or Gavel.  I used to be involved in writing code, but that was years ago.  I am starting my own Repository because I want to design my own Project Management / Task Management / Productivity application / software.  I have used probably 50 different apps and I haven't found "The One" that fits me.  I am using 3 right now just to help me keep on task.  
I use Mac OS, Windows 10 and Linux.  At work I use Windows 10.  That's the other thing, when I find a good application that I am truly interested, I learn that the security of that app depends on the company that owns it.  I want to keep my data on my computer only.  I do not want my data to be "out there."  Obsidian is probably the closest piece of software I have to be almost perfect for me.  Everything is local and that is a huge plus.
But, It doesn't offer everything I want or need.  Maybe I shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel and just write a plug in for everything I want in Obsidian.  That's a thought.  Anyway, I will search on here for a good program and see what I can do to add to it.  So for now, I will be reading a lot on GitHub and see what everyone is doing for Task Management workflow.  
Keep coming back...you never know when you will find a great piece of software on this page!

Thanks,

Gavel
